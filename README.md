# Memory notes for Breath of the Wild
#### This repo contains information about the memory Breath of the Wild uses.
---

I've only included the information I know of at the moment.

If you know of any more Addresses/Pointer information or if I got something wrong, feel free to create a pull request. Just make sure whatever you add has something to do with the list below!

Includes:

* [Address Information, what they do, etc](https://github.com/Megabyte918/BotW-Memory-Notes/blob/master/ADDRESSES.md)
* [Pointer Information, where they lead to, etc](https://github.com/Megabyte918/BotW-Memory-Notes/blob/master/POINTERS.md)
* [Button Activators, for Gamepad and Pro Controller](https://github.com/Megabyte918/BotW-Memory-Notes/blob/master/ACTIVATORS.md)
* [Memory dump of every address (for creating pointers)](#full-botw-memory-dump-v120-usa)

## Full BotW Memory Dump (v1.2.0, USA)
From Addresses 0C900000 to 4C8A0000. Can be used to create pointers from any starting address without creating new dumps every time.
I recommend using BullyWiiPlaza's [Universal Pointer Searcher](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/Universal-Pointer-Searcher) to create pointers using this dump.
